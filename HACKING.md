# How to add an input?

There are two types of inputs: boolean flags and string options. Some of the steps below are conditional on which type of input you're specifying. These will be prefixed by (Flag) or (Option).

1. Add the input to the `inputs` dictionary in `action.yml`:

   - Create a new entry in `inputs` where the key is the option name.
   - Add a description field. Descriptions are automatically included in the `README.md`, and can be styled using Markdown.
   - Add `required: false`. No input should be mandatory.
   - (Flag)
     The default value is always false, do not specify `default`.
   - (Option)
     Specify a default value as `default: XXX`.

2. Add the input to `BuildOptions` in `opts/types.ts`:

   - (Flag)
     Add the input name to the `SetupAgdaFlag` type in `opts/types.ts`; or
   - (Option)
     Add the input name to the `SetupAgdaOption` type in `opts/types.ts`.

   The `SetupAgdaFlag` and `SetupAgdaOption` types are merged into the `SetupAgdaInputs` type, which is itself merged into `BuildOptions`.

3. Set the input in the `getOptions` function in `opts/get-options.ts`:

   Set the input in the defintion of `options` in the body of `getOptions`.
   Options defined in `SetupAgdaInputs` are set in alphabetical order, under the following comment:

   ```javascript
   // Specified in opts.SetupAgdaInputs
   ```

   For most inputs, you can simply add the following line:

   - (Flag)
     Add `'flag-name': getFlag('flag-name'),` .
   - (Option)
     Add `'option-name': getOption('option-name'),`.

   If your input needs validation or special handling, you can add this in the body of `getOptions` above the definition of the `options` object, _e.g._, as done for `agda-version`.

4. Congratulations, you're done!

# How does `setup-agda` work?

`setup-agda` is a GitHub Action which downloads or builds various Agda
versions.

The `src` directory contains all source code for the action in TypeScript.

The `lib` directory contains the _compiled_ code in JavaScript. This directory
is generated by calling `npm run build`.

The `dist` directory contains the _packaged_ code, which bundles the compiled
code of this library and _all its dependencies_ into a single JavaScript file,
(`index.js`), a mapping file (`index.js.map`), and the combined licenses of all
dependencies (`licenses.txt`).
This directory is generated by calling `npm run package`.
The `index.js` file is the _actual_ entry point for GitHub Actions.

When run the action proceeds as follows:

0.  **gather inputs**

    The entry for the GitHub Action is `main.ts`, which gathers the inputs for the action, validates them, and passes them to `setup-agda`.

    Specifically, the function used to gather and validate the inputs is `opts.getOptions`, which is passed one argument, `core.getInput`.
    The argument determines how the options are retrieved, and `core.getInput` is provided by GitHub Actions.

    (`setup-agda` can also be used as a library, in which case the user will pass in a different function for getting inputs.)

    `opts.getOptions` contains all the logic for parsing and validating inputs.

    It resolves the Agda version (`./src/opts/resolve-agda-version`):

    - if the user passes "latest" it resolves that to the latest known version by checking `./src/data/Agda.versions.normal.json`, which lists all known versions (as returned by Hackage); or
    - if the user passes a specific version number, it checks if that version is a known version by checking the above file, and checks that it is not deprecated by checking `./src/data/Agda.versions.deprecated.json`.

    The files `Agda.versions.normal.json` and `Agda.versions.deprecated.json` can be updated by calling `npm run update-agda-info`.

    It resolves the agda-stdlib version (`./src/opts/resolve-agda-stdlib-version`):

    - if the user passes "latest" it resolves that to the latest known version by checking `./src/data/agda-stdlib.sdist.json`, which lists all known versions (as found on GitHub); or
    - if the user passes "recommended" it resolves that to the latest known version that is known to be compatible with the requested Agda version by checking `./src/data/Agda.agda-stdlib-compat.json`, which lists all compatible versions (as found on [the Agda Wiki][standardlibrarycompat]).

    The files `agda-stdlib.sdist.json` and `Agda.agda-stdlib-compat.json` require manual maintenance when a new version of `agda-stdlib` is released.

1.  **try the GitHub tool cache**

    See `./src/setup-agda/install-from-tool-cache.ts`.

    The action, in an act of _pure optimism_, checks whether or not Agda is included in the GitHub tool cache. This will _never_ return a result on the GitHub runners, unless GitHub decides to preinstall Agda. However, it _will_ return a result on a custom runner which includes Agda.

2.  **try our custom binary distributions**

    See `./src/setup-agda/install-from-bdist`.

    The action checks `./src/data/Agda.bdist.json` to see if there is a distribution suitable for the requested Agda version which is compatible with the current platform.

    The file `Agda.bdist.json` requires manual maintenance whenever a support for a new binary distribution is added.

    Generally, the binary distributions are generally stored on the [`latest`][latest] release on GitHub, but theoretically, the index could list any URL.

    If a binary distribution is found, the action downloads it, tests it, and installs it.

3.  **build from source**

    See `./src/setup-agda/build-from-sdist`.

    If there are no binary distributions, the action tries to build Agda from source.

    If `enable-stack` was passed it tries to build Agda with Stack, otherwise it tries to build Agda with Cabal.

    - Download the source from Hackage or GitHub.

      See `getAgdaSdist` in `./src/util/agda.ts`.

    - Setup GHC with `haskell/actions/setup`.

      See `./src/setup-haskell.ts`.

      We determine the compatible GHC versions:

      - When building with Cabal, we inspect the `tested-with` field in `Agda.cabal`.

        See `supportedGhcVersions` in `./src/setup-agda/build-from-sdist/cabal.ts`.

      - When building with Stack, we look for `stack-X.Y.Z.yaml` files.

        See `supportedGhcVersions` in `./src/setup-agda/build-from-sdist/stack.ts`.

      We pick the latest compatible GHC version.

      If the `ghc-version-range` input is passed, we only pick versions that _also_ satisfy that version range.

      If the `ghc-version` input is passed, we _ignore compatibility_ and use that version.

      See `./src/opts/resolve-ghc-version.ts`.

    - If building with `--enable-cluster-counting`, setup ICU.

      By default, we build with `--enable-cluster-counting` for any version which supports it and for which we know how to install ICU.

      See `setup` in `./src/setup-icu.ts` and both `supportsClusterCounting` and `needsIcu` in `./opts/compat.ts`.

    - Build Agda.

      See `build` in `./src/setup-agda/build-from-sdist/cabal.ts` and `./src/setup-agda/build-from-sdist/stack.ts`.

    - Test Agda.

      We test Agda by compiling its builtin modules.

      See `agdaTest` in `./src/util/agda.ts`.

    - Install Agda.

      We copy the Agda binaries and data files to `AGDA_DIR/agda/{agda-version}/` and configure the environment so `agda` and `agda-mode` are on the PATH and `Agda_datadir` points to the data files.

      See `configureEnvFor` in `./src/util/agda.ts`.

4.  **setup libraries**

    If the user passed `agda-stdlib-version` or `agda-libraries`, we install each library to `AGDA_DIR/libraries.d/{library-name}/{library-version}/` and register them in the libraries file.

    If the user passed `agda-stdlib-default` or `agda-defaults` we register each library in the defaults file.

5.  **upload binary distribution**

    If the user passed `bdist-upload`, we package a binary distribution, and upload it as a GitHub artifact.

    See `./src/setup-agda/upload-bdist.ts`.

    If the Agda library was compiled with `--enable-cluster-counting`, we bundle ICU.

    See `bundle` in `./src/setup-icu.ts`.

    If the user passed `bdist-compress-exe`, we compress the binaries with UPX.

    See `./src/setup-upx.ts` and `compressBin` in `./src/setup-agda/upload-bdist.ts`.

    This is the method by which the custom binary distributions are produced.
