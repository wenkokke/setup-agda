name: setup nightly

# Setting up nightly versions is brittle, since it depends on the status of
# the upstream agda/agda repository. It requires both that the HEAD version
# builds & that deploy.yml succeeds in publishing a nightly release.
#
# We only run 'setup-nightly' after the 'setup.yml' completes, and we don't
# require a successful run of 'setup-nightly' to move the latest tag.
